# ChatGPT-Framework
Created by: Phoenix C
Tools: ChatGPT Framework

Description: ChatGPT Framework is a framework to use all possibilities of AI ChatGPT
    of Opanai. It requires a valid API key. If you don't have one:
    1: Go to https://openai.com and create an account. Click on View API key then on create a new API.
    2: Copy it and enter it in the program when requested.

    The program will create an API.txt file and check for its existence each time. This has the advantage:
    If you delete the file, the program will recreate it. You will just need to retype the API.
    This also allows not to type each time the API is used.

    DISCLAIMER: The program only takes care of querying a ChatGPT module according to your needs.
        Under no circumstances will the creator be responsible for an inappropriate or incorrect response.
        He cannot also be held responsible for any malicious use of the software.
